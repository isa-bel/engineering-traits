# Daily Standup

Daily standups are part of the [Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

* Prioritizes the daily standups. The daily communication with the client is more important than running morning errands.
* Gives clear standup updates that communicate what are you doing.
* Translates technical details into to day to day words.
* Joins the standups on time.
* Tailors their communication to their audience level of technicality and needs.

In the standup:

* Learns from the problems the others have.
* Sees if you can help with the problems of others.
* Shares knowledge to help your daily job.
* How can we adapt it so that it is valuable for our team? Why is it helpful?
