# Pull Requests

### What is a Pull Request?

**Note:** A Pull Request, or PR, is a GitHub mechanism, is not part of `git`.

### Creating Pull Requests

* Use a PR template that includes steps to test the PR and screenshots for the frontend.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

* Test the feature branches locally to detect bugs early.
* Review the logic and code conventions.
* Don't approve PRs just because.
* Be committed with high code quality.

#### Giving Feedback

* Give constructive feedback in code reviews or directly to other team members.
* Add enough context or related code examples in the PR comments.
