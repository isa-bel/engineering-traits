# Methodology

To gather the traits or skills a successful engineer should develop, we conducted a series of interviews. The pool of interviewees includes lead software engineers, DevOps, QA, UX, TW, PjMs, BRMs, etc.

To prioritize these traits, we created a card sorting exercise with the same pool of interviewees.


## Interviewees Demographics

| Roles | Participants |
|-------|--------------|
| Software Engineers | 6 |
| Business  ([BRM](#business-relationship-manager), [PjM](#project-management-director)) | 2 |
| Delivery ([DevOps](#devops-engineering-manager), [QA](#software-engineer-in-test), [UX](#user-experience-designer), [TW](#technical-writer)) | 4 |
| Others ([Academy](#academy-sr-program-manager), [Security](#sr-application-security-engineer)) | 2 |

## Interview Questions

In the interviews, we asked the following questions:

* What do you think a great engineer should know?
* My team achieves their goals because the engineers know or do X.
* What could an engineer do to make your job easier?
* I wish every engineer at our company knew/did X.
* What do you think prevents developers from delivering?
* The engineers in my team are great because they do X.
* What things you have to fight against or for in your project?
* What do engineers in successful teams do that engineers in other teams don't?

## Prioritization

To prioritize the traits, we used a Card Sorting exercise based in the ideas of [this article](https://blog.optimalworkshop.com/andy-using-optimalsort-prioritize-product-improvements).

As in the article, we calculated the _weighted priority_ with the following formula:

    WP = 4 * times placed in “Most important” + 2 * times placed in “Very important” + times placed in “Important”
