## Naming

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.  
> — Phil Karlton

### Why is **naming** important?

Code should be readable to computers and other engineers. Giving meaningful names to methods, variables, classes, and improves readability

### Tips for Better Naming

* Follow the conventions of the language or framework you are using. For example, Python prefers `snake_case` and JavaScript `camelCase`.
* Ask your team if there are any naming conventions you should follow to keep consistency.
* If a method returns a boolean or your variable is a boolean, try to start its name with `is`.
* If a variable represents an array or a list, use a plural name.
* Avoid generic names such as `data`, `object`, etc.
